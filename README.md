go-ck101 (我愛卡提諾)
=====================

This morning I saw in my Facebook news feed a handy tool called 
[我愛卡提諾](https://github.com/tzangms/iloveck101) was created to help scrape and 
crawl images from the popular forum ck101.com.  The tool was written in python 
so to keep myself entertained during lunch hour I decided to rewrite it in my 
current favorite language golang.

The tool scrapes a page on [CK101.com](http://ck101.com/) and stores all large
images in your local home directory (`~/Pictures/go-ck101`).  This should work
for most linux-based machines.

In addition to being available as a CLI tool, the tool (due to request from
a number of people :p) is now also avaialble in the form of a library to be 
imported as part of a bigger project.

The tool is fully capable of scraping content which requires login.  Enjoy~
